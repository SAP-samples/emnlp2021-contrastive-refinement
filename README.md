## Description

In this repository we will provide the source code for the paper *Towards Zero-shot Commonsense Reasoning with Self-supervised Refinement of Language Models* to be presented at  [EMNLP 2021](https://2021.emnlp.org/). The code is in parts based on the code from [Huggingface Tranformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) and the paper [A Surprisingly Robust Trick for Winograd Schema Challenge](https://github.com/vid-koci/bert-commonsense).
